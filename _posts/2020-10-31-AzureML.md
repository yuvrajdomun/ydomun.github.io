excerpt: "Cloud Service providers give access to a wide range of tools. After Passing my Azure Data Scientist Exam, I wrote a series of notebooks for my reference"

I finally took and passed my Azure Data Science Certification. As an experienced data scientist, I think this is a good tool to have in your arsenal. I would recommend this tool to someone who is experienced and already an understanding of what it takes to deploy Data Science Solutions. It is not a course if you are looking to learn about Data Science and some of the core concept.

Through the course, you learn how to use AzureMl and itâ€™s python SDK to train model, build pipelines for experiments and deploy Machine Learning models to production in an efficient way.

I am someone who belive in Hands On learning. When doing the course, I rewrote all the notebooks from scrapts and played around with the Python SDK. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/yuvrajdomun/azureml">Github repo</a> to see the materials. You can use this material to prepare for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-data-scientist">Azure Data Scientist certification</a>.

My highlight of the course was learning the Python SDK for AzureML. They provide some nice functionalities that can be integrated when writin data pipelines that simplifies thet steps required to productionise Data Science Models in Azure.
