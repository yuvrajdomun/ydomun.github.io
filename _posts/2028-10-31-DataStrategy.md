Data scientist often needs to have access to a multitude of production data sets to be able to build systems that can churn valuable insights from data. Many organisation still uses last century's technology and a code-first approach: hence why data scientist are often stuck in long, painful waterfall processes.

# A Data Strategy: Making Data a first-class citizen

Data strategy talks about the importance of Data Strategy. And list a generic framework that can be used to develop and implement a good data strategy.

**Why do we need a data strategy?**

Data scientist often needs to have access to a multitude of production data sets to be able to build systems that can churn valuable insights from data. Many organisation still uses last century's technology and a code-first approach: hence why data scientist are often stuck in long, painful waterfall processes. A paradigm shift is required for an organisation to be able to deal with the volume, variety, veracity and velocity of data. The multitude of analytical approaches and diversity of use cases require much more flexible and agile use of data.

> For example, to build a predictive maintenance system, a data scientist needs data such about asset condition, historical work orders, employee rota and schedule. Having the right permission and technology to access and combine these datasets can be tedious without the right processes and technology in place. Using a code-first approach would require a month of planning and stakeholder engagement to build the technical solution for acquiring and merging these data.

However, paradigm shift means a long and expensive change management program. And the reality is many organisations have a limited budget.  A good strategy makes organisations proactive, identify key problems to fix, and inform on actions to make for future opportunity.

What do we need to deliver data science at Scale?

The first step to a good data strategy is to understand what is the process a unit of data needs to move through in order to be transformed to value.


We know the steps data needs to move through, the next step is building a realistic picture of where we are as an organisation. We focus on 5 key aspects:

1. The organisation
2. The people
3. The process
4. The technology
5. The data asset

**What do we need to do?**

The next step is understanding the gaps within our organisation. The way we do this gap analysis is by generating analytics initiative. These are initiative that has the potential to directly impact key metrics: KPIs, OCR, etc. Making a backward pass through the data lifecycle with each initiative to help identify key vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities inform the strategic objectives: what we need to do as an organisation.


How do you make data science and analytics work for you? Well, it starts with a good data strategy. A good data strategy helps us understand the following:

1. Where do we want to be?
2. Where are we now?
3. How do we get there?
